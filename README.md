### Introduction:
Stock market prices are driven by profit expectations or corporate earnings. If a trader believes that the earnings of their respective company are inflating or will ascend further, they will raise the base price of the stock. One of the most common ways for shareholders is to buy low stocks and sell them at high prices to get a higher return on their investments. As a result, if the company performs poorly and the value of the stock plummets, the shareholder will lose some or all of their investments at the time of sale. Therefore, it is imperative to have an accurate stock price predictive system to infer better information about the future price by analyzing historical prices.
